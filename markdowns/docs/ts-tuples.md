# TypeScript Tuples

## Typed Arrays

A **tuple** is a typed [array](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) with a pre-defined length and types for each index.

Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known type of value.

To define a tuple, specify the type of each element in the array:

**Example:**

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, "Coding God was here"];
```

As you can see we have a number, boolean and a string. But what happens if we try to set them in the wrong order:

**Example:**

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialized incorrectly which throws an error
ourTuple = [false, "Coding God was mistaken", 5];
```

Even though we have a `boolean`, `string`, and `number` the order matters in our tuple and will throw an error.

## Readonly Tuple

A good practice is to make your **tuple** `readonly`.

Tuples only have strongly defined types for the initial values:

**Example:**

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, "Coding God was here"];
// We have no type safety in our tuple for indexes 3+
ourTuple.push("Something new and wrong");
console.log(ourTuple);
```

You see the new valueTuples only have strongly defined types for the initial values:

**Example:**

```ts
// define our readonly tuple
const ourReadonlyTuple: readonly [number, boolean, string] = [
  5,
  true,
  "The Real Coding God",
];
// throws error as it is readonly.
ourReadonlyTuple.push("Coding God took a day off");
```

To learn more about access modifiers like `readonly` go to our section on them here: [TypeScript Classes](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_classes.php).

If you have ever used React before you have worked with tuples more than likely.

`useState` returns a tuple of the value and a setter function.

`const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Noyon')` is a common example.

Because of the structure we know our first value in our list will be a certain value type in this case a `string` and the second value a `function`.

## Named Tuples

**Named tuples** allow us to provide context for our values at each index.

**Example:**

```ts
const graph: [x: number, y: number] = [55.2, 41.3];
```

**Named tuples** provide more context for what our index values represent.

## Destructuring Tuples

Since tuples are arrays we can also destructure them.

**Example:**

```ts
const graph: [number, number] = [55.2, 41.3];
const [x, y] = graph;
```
