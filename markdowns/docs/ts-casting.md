# TypeScript Casting

There are times when working with types where it's necessary to override the type of a variable, such as when incorrect types are provided by a library.

Casting is the process of overriding a type.

## Casting with as

A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the `as` keyword, which will directly change the type of the given variable.

**Example:**

```ts
let x: unknown = "hello";
console.log((x as string).length);
```

Casting doesn't actually change the type of the data within the variable, for example the following code will not work as expected since the variable `x` is still holds a number.

```ts
let x: unknown = 4;
console.log((x as string).length); // prints undefined since numbers don't have a length
```

TypeScript will still attempt to typecheck casts to prevent casts that don't seem correct, for example the following will throw a type error since TypeScript knows casting a string to a number doesn't makes sense without converting the data:

```ts
console.log((4 as string).length); // Error: Conversion of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
```

The Force casting section below covers how to override this.

## Casting with <>

Using <> works the same as casting with `as`.

**Example:**

```ts
let x: unknown = "hello";
console.log((<string>x).length);
```

This type of casting will not work with TSX, such as when working on React files.

## Force casting

To override type errors that TypeScript may throw when casting, first cast to `unknown`, then to the target type.

**Example:**

```ts
let x = "hello";
console.log((x as unknown as number).length); // x is not actually a number so this will return undefined
```
