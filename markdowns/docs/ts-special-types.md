# TypeScript Special Types

TypeScript has special types that may not refer to any specific type of data.

## Type: any

`any` is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.\*\*

**The example below does not use `any` and will throw an error:**

**Example without any:**

```ts
let u = true;
u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
Math.round(u); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

Setting `any` to the special type `any` disables type checking:

**Example with any:**

```ts
let v: any = true;
v = "string"; // no error as it can be "any" type
Math.round(v); // no error as it can be "any" type
```

`any` can be a useful way to get past errors since it disables type checking, but TypeScript will not be able provide type safety, and tools which rely on type data, such as auto completion, will not work. Remember, it should be avoided at "any" cost...

## Type: unknown

`unknown` is a similar, but safer alternative to `any`.

TypeScript will prevent `unknown` types from being used, as shown in the below example:

```ts
let w: unknown = 1;
w = "string"; // no error
w = {
  runANonExistentMethod: () => {
    console.log("I think therefore I am");
  },
} as { runANonExistentMethod: () => void };
// How can we avoid the error for the code commented out below when we don't know the type?
// w.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
if (typeof w === "object" && w !== null) {
  (w as { runANonExistentMethod: Function }).runANonExistentMethod();
}
// Although we have to cast multiple times we can do a check in the if to secure our type and have a safer casting
```

Compare the example above to the previous example, with `any`.

`unknown` is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. To add a type later, you'll need to cast it.

Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say property or variable is of the casted type.

## Type: never

`never` effectively throws an error whenever it is defined.

```ts
let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.
```

`never` is rarely used, especially by itself, its primary use is in advanced generics.

## Type: undefined & null

`undefined` and `null` are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives `undefined` and `null` respectively.

```tsx
let y: undefined = undefined;
let z: null = null;
```

These types don't have much use unless `strictNullChecks` is enabled in the `tsconfig.json` file.
