/**
 * TypeScript 5.x Updates
 */
/* 
TypeScript is actively maintained and updated by Microsoft. In version 5.x a lot of utility and quality of life updates were made.

This chapter covers the most popular updates to allow stricter and more flexible type safety
*/
// As a reminder these features will only be available in 5.x+

/**
 * Template Literal Types
 * Template Literal Types now allows us to create more precise types using template literals. We can define custom types that depend on the actual values of strings at compile time.
 */
type Color = "red" | "green" | "blue";
type HexColor<T extends Color> = `#${string}`;

// Usage:
let myColor: HexColor<"blue"> = "#0000FF"


/**
 * Index Signature Labels
 * Index Signature Labels allows us to label index signatures using computed property names. It helps in providing more descriptive type information
when working with dynamic objects.
 */
type DynamicObject = { [key: string as `dynamic_${string}`]: string }

// Usage:
let obj: DynamicObject = { dynamic_key: "value" }

// 5.x also now supports native JavaScript private fields. The TypeScript 'private' still works as discussed in Classes section.
