/**
 * TypeScript Simple Types
 * TypeScript supports some simple types (primitives) you may know.
 */

/* 
There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.
  - boolean - true or false values
  - number - whole numbers and floating point values
  - string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"

There are also 2 less common primitives used in later versions of Javascript and TypeScript.
  - bigint - whole numbers and floating point values, but allows larger negative and positive numbers than the number type.
  - symbol are used to create a globally unique identifier.
 */

/**
 * Type Assignment
 * When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
 * 1. Explicit
 * 2.Implicit
 * In both examples below firstName is of type string
 */

/**
 * Explicit Type
 * Explicit - writing out the type:
 */
let devName: string = "Noyon";
// Explicit type assignment are easier to read and more intentional.

/**
 * Implicit Type
 * Implicit - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:
 */
let firstName = "Noyon";
// Note: Having TypeScript "guess" the type of a value is called infer.

/**
 * Implicit assignment forces TypeScript to infer the value.
 * Implicit type assignment are shorter, faster to type, and often used when developing and testing.
 */

/**
 * Error In Type Assignment
 * TypeScript will throw an error if data types do not match.
 */
let myName: string = "Noyon"; // type string
myName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type

// Implicit type assignment would have made firstName less noticeable as a string, but both will throw an error:
let firstName = "Dylan"; // inferred to type string
firstName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type
// JavaScript will not throw an error for mismatched types.

/**
 * Unable to Infer
 * TypeScript may not always properly infer what the type of a variable may be. In such cases, it will set the type to any which disables type checking.
 */
// Implicit any as JSON.parse doesn't know what type of data it returns so it can be "any" thing...
const json = JSON.parse("55");
// Most expect json to be an object, but it can be a string or a number like this example
console.log(typeof json);

/* This behavior can be disabled by enabling noImplicitAny as an option in a TypeScript's project tsconfig.json. That is a JSON config file for customizing how some of TypeScript behaves. */

/* 
Note: you may see primitive types capitalized like Boolean.
boolean !== Boolean
For this tutorial just know to use the lower-cased values, the upper-case ones are for very specific circumstances.
